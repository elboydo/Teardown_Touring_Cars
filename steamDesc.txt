Please note, this is a heavy alpha release 

[h1]Features [/h1]

[h1]tracks:[/h1] 

In the current release, there are 4 maps: 


[list]
	[*] Skogs Entrada: A historical track in lockelle, with fantastic hair pins and fast paced straights, a fantastic track for all.

	[*] BlueTide Ring: A race track setup by the bluetride corporation, a track with tight corners and fast straights!

	[*] Norrbotten Hills Raceway: A fast quarter mile styled track, modelled off british banger racing tracks. Fast, quick, tight, be careful to avoid pileups!.

Please feel free to rip and tear all you can at the code of this. It's very clunky and clearly been repurposed from open ai to racing ai. I also included the stages to achieving this ai (such as clustering and so on). While pathfinding is around the corner, i hope this helps others develop their own vehicle based solutions. 

I heavily advise ripping the PID code for vehicles, it can be heavily modified and will work with the new ai (to my belief), it will conrol your vehicles provided you modify it proper. Give me a shout in the discord for help. 


[h1]Notes [/h1]
This is a year of effort, I thank the devs for their amazing support and adding the features to make this possible.
